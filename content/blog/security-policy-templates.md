- [NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fasp/areas.html) has a good list
- The department of the interior [handbook](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fasp/documents/policy_procedure/PHB_09172007compat_Final_651.doc) to be quite a good and comprehensive resource.
- The [CMS IS policy](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fasp/documents/pm/IS_policy.doc) seems to be a good over-reaching policy for starting policy
- UCISA has a good [toolkit](http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/publications/toolkit.aspx)
