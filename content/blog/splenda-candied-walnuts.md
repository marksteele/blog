Ingredients:

```
Enough walnuts to cover your baking sheet, let.s say 2 cups.
About 3 cups of granulated Splenda
Just enough allspice
A good splash of vanilla extract
1 egg white
Enough salt to make it salty (1/4 teaspoon maybe?)
2 tbsp melted butter
```

Beat the egg until it.s thoroughly beat, and no longer offers resistance. Throw in everything else, mix it around. Line your baking sheet with foil, spray with pam. Spread in the mixture, making sure everything is not all one big clump.

Pre-heat oven at 350, cook for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 and stir (unstick those clumps!). Wait 10 minutes, stir again. Done.
