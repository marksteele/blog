Here's a Spring Boot template/tutorial that I've put together to try to get some best practices codified on how to quickly throw together a service.

We'll cover: setting up REST endpoints, scheduled tasks, thread-pools to parallelize work, React, MySQL, 12-factor app best practices, OAuth2 (google), monitoring, unit testing, code coverage, project mess detection, spotbugs, DevOps and more!
